# Data-Visualization-in-Power-BI

## Overview
This sales dashboard in Power BI provides a comprehensive view of a Company's sales performance and key metrics from 2019 - 2023. It allowed me to analyze sales data, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions to drive business growth.

## Features
- Interactive Visualizations: The dashboard includes visually appealing charts, graphs, and tables that provide a clear representation of sales data.
- Sales Performance Metrics: I tracked key performance indicators such as total sales over the years, sales by region, top-selling products, and more.
- Filters and Slicers: I used filters and slicers to customize the view and analyze sales data based on specific criteria.
